While on an Intergalactic Numismatics Tour, you encounter a meteor shower and are forced to make an unscheduled stop on the planet Quintopia.  The monetary system used in Quintopia consists of three coins:  a yellow coin (worth \textdollar{}1US), a red coin (worth five yellow coins), and a blue coin (worth five red coins).%

Quintopia turns out to be a rather dull place to visit.  To help pass the time at the shuttle docking area, you and a fellow passenger play a game with the Quintopia currency.%
