(Quick Warm UP Problem) At one table there are 4 pizzas and 8 chairs.  At the other table there are 4 pizzas and 10 chairs.  Carlos knows that everyone at the party is pretty hungry, and assumes that the pizzas at each table will be split evenly, so he wants to sit at the table at which he will end up with the most pizza.  Which table should he choose?  Assume that the pizzas are uncut until all chairs at the table are occupied.%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.1}{exercise-502359914560}%

What if, at one table there are 3 pizzas and 8 chairs, and at the other table there are 4 pizzas and 10 chairs.  Carlos, again, knows that everyone at the party is pretty hungry, and assumes that the pizzas at each table will be split evenly.  He still wants to sit at the table at which he will end up with the most pizza.  Which table should he choose in this situation? Assume that the pizzas are uncut until all chairs at the table are occupied.%

Now, assume that each pizza is already cut into 12 equal pieces. At one table there are 3 pizzas and 8 chairs.  At the other table there are 4 pizzas and 10 chairs.  Which table should he choose?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.1}{exercise-502359911296}%
\hypertarget{p-502359910656}{}%
Suppose now that, instead of dividing up the pizza separately at each table, the hosts decide to give all 18 people equal amounts from the 7 pizzas.  Carlos realizes that this means that the amount everyone ends up with is in between the amounts they would have ended up with if each pizza had only been shared among those at the same table.  How can we state this observation in terms of fractions?  How can we state this observation in terms of straight-line graphs?  Is there a general relationship about fractions that this is illustrating?  Is there a general graphical relationship that this is illustrating?%

\begin{introduction}{}%
\hypertarget{p-502359932992}{}%
While on an Intergalactic Numismatics Tour, you encounter a meteor shower and are forced to make an unscheduled stop on the planet Quintopia.  The monetary system used in Quintopia consists of three coins:  a yellow coin (worth \textdollar{}1US), a red coin (worth five yellow coins), and a blue coin (worth five red coins).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359891328}{}%
Quintopia turns out to be a rather dull place to visit.  To help pass the time at the shuttle docking area, you and a fellow passenger play a game with the Quintopia currency.%

Coin Trading Game%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359889600}{}%
Materials:  Quintopia coins (yellow, red and blue), one die (number cube)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359889216}{}%
Players:  2 or more%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359888832}{}%
Rules:  The youngest player starts, and players alternate turns afterwards.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359888352}{}%
On each turn, a player rolls the die and places that many yellow coins on his or her game sheet (see below).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359887840}{}%
Whenever possible, a player MUST trade in five yellow coins for a red coin, or trade in five red coins for a blue coin, and place them in their respective columns.  As a result, no more than four coins of any one color should be a player’s game sheet.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359887184}{}%
The first player to get two blue coins is the winner.%

Coin Trading Game Revisited%
\par
\hypertarget{p-502359878704}{}%
A third passenger has been watching you play.  She suggests it is more challenging to start the game with TWO BLUE coins and to remove the number of yellow coins equal to the number rolled on each turn.  The first player to remove all of the coins from his or her playing board is the winner.  (Note: On the last turn, the number rolled may exceed the number of yellow chips remaining.)  Before you play this new version of the coin trading game, think about how you can remove yellow coins when you have none on your board (you only have two blue ones).  Note: Do not trade in coins until you absolutely need to.  For example, you should not immediately trade in your two blue coins all for red or yellow coins.%
