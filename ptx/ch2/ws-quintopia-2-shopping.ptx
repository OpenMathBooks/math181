  <title>Shopping in Quintopia</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>You got bored on the ship deck and decided to visit Quintopia to do some shopping. You know you can only use Quintopian currency while shopping, so you exchange some of your US dollars before your shopping and you have <m>312_{5}</m> (in Quintopian currency), which means 3 blue, 1 red, and 2 yellow coins. While youâ€™re shopping, recall that whenever possible, you must trade in five yellow coins for a red coin, or trade in five red coins for a blue coin, and so on.</p>
