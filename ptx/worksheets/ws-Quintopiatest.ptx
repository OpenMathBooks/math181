		<title>A Trip to Quintopia!</title>

	<p>
		While on an Intergalactic Numismatics Tour, <term>you encounter a meteor shower</term> and are forced to make an unscheduled stop on the planet Quintopia. The monetary system used in Quintopia consists of three coins: a yellow coin (worth $1US), a red coin (worth five yellow coins), and a blue coin (worth five red coins).
	</p>

	<p>
		Unlike its sister planet, Ufouria, Quintopia turns out to be a rather dull place to visit. To help pass the time at the shuttle docking area, you and a fellow passenger play a game with the Quintopia currency:

		<title><em>Coin Trading Game</em></title>

		<p>
			<em>Materials:</em> Quintopia coins (yellow, red and blue), one die (number cube)
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Players:</em> 2 or more
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Rules:</em> The youngest player starts, and players alternate turns afterwards.
		</p>

		<p>
			On each turn, a player rolls the die and places that many yellow coins on his or her game sheet (see below).
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="underline">Whenever possible</span>, a player must trade in <span class="underline">five yellow coins for a red coin</span>, or trade in <span class="underline">five red coins for a blue coin</span>, and place them in their respective columns. As a result, <span class="underline">no more than four coins of any one color</span> should be a player’s game sheet.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first player to get <em><span class="underline">two blue</span></em> coins is the winner.

			<em>Coin Trading Game Revisited</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			A third passenger has been watching you play. She suggests it is more challenging to start the game with <em>TWO BLUE</em> coins and to remove the number of yellow coins equal to the number rolled on each turn. The first player to remove all of the coins from his or her playing board is the winner. (Note: On the last turn, the number rolled may exceed the number of yellow chips remaining.) Before you play this new version of the coin trading game, think about how you can remove yellow coins when you have none on your board (you only have two blue ones).
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Note:</em> Do not trade in coins until you absolutely need to – for example, you should not immediately trade in your two blue coins all for red or yellow coins.

			<em>Shopping in Quintopia</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			You got bored on the ship deck and decided to visit Quintopia to do some shopping. You know you can only use Quintopian currency while shopping so you exchange some of your US dollars before your shopping and you have 312<sub>5</sub> (in Quintopian currency), which means 3 blue, 1 red, and 2 yellows. While you’re shopping, recall that <span class="underline">whenever possible</span>, you must trade in five yellow coins for a red coin, or trade in five red coins for a blue coin, and so on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Question 1:</em> Before you left the ship, you won a gift card worth 24<sub>5</sub> (in Quintopian currency). How much total money do you have now for shopping? Show your process at least in two different ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Question 2:</term> You spent 43<sub>5</sub> at Appletopia store. How much Quintopian money do you have left? Explain your process.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term><!-- linebreak --></term>
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Question 3:</term> You saw a pair of shoes you like and it only costs 32<sub>5</sub>. Since it is very cheap, you want to buy three pairs. How much will it cost to buy three pairs of shoes (in Quintopia currency)? Solve this question in two different ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Question 4:</term> After buying all three pairs of shoes, how much money do you have left?
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Question 5:</term> After all your shopping you had some dinner which cost 102<sub>5</sub>. Do you have enough Quintopian money to pay? If not, how much Quintopian money do you need? If you have an extra
		</p>

		<p>
			$6 US currency, will that be enough to pay the rest?
