  <title>Egyptian Fractions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The ancient Egyptians wrote any fraction as a sum of fractions with numerators of 1 and all different denominators.  For example they would have expressed <m> \frac{2}{3} </m> as <m> \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} </m> (their notation was different than this).  Fractions expressed as a sum of fractions with numerators of 1 and denominators that are all different are often called “Egyptian Fractions” for this reason.
