  <title>Integer Arithmetic Situations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The set of numbers called the <i>integers</i> is a subset of the <i>real numbers</i> (any number that can be found on the number line).  The set is comprised of <i>positive integers</i> (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), <i>negative integers</i> (-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.), and 0, which is neither positive nor negative.  Use your knowledge of integers and their opposites to complete this activity.

        Investigate what happens when you calculate <q>6-3</q>;  <q>6-2</q>;  <q>6-1</q> ;<q>6-0</q>; <q>6-(-1)</q>;     <q>6-(-2)</q>; <q>6-(-3)</q>.  Explain why it <i> makes sense </i> that 6- (-3) = 6+3 = 9.   Refer to a pattern you notice in your calculation.
