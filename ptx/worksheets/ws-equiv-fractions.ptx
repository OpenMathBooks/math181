        Now, represent <m> \frac{2}{3} </m> using a fraction bar (tape diagram). Then, show  <m> \frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 2} </m> on the model. What is the answer? In your picture, where do we see multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2? Be very specific!!!

        	Jean has a casserole recipe that calls for <m> \frac{1}{2} </m> cup of butter. Jean only has <m> \frac{1}{3} </m> cup of butter. Assuming that Jean has enough of the other ingredients what fractions of the casserole recipe can Jean make? Make math drawings or use manipulatives to help you solve this problem. Explain why your answer is correct. In your explanation, attend carefully to the whole (unit amount) that each fraction is of.
