      <b>Exploration #1</b>: Recall A <m> \times </m> B refers to the number of objects in A groups of B objects.  The product A <m> \times </m> B gives the total number of objects.  For the following story problems, write the corresponding multiplication statement and explicitly identify what are the groups, what are the objects in each group, and what does the product represent.

      Dave and Roberto want to know how many one-inch-by-one-inch squares it would take to cover the floor of a room that is 10 feet by 8 feet.  They multiply 10 by 8 by 12 and decide that they would need 960 one-inch squares.  Their calculation is incorrect, explain why it is incorrect and why Dave and Roberto might be thinking this way.

      In a school project students make short, pretend license plates for their model cars.  The license plates can only use the letters A, B, and C and the numbers 1 and 2.  There must be two letters followed by two numbers, and letters and numbers can be used over again.  For example, one possible license plate is AA11. Another is CA21. How many total license plates of this type can be made?
