# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

#   1) Do make a copy of Makefile.paths.original
#      as Makefile.paths (which will be ignored by git)
#   2) Edit Makefile.paths to provide full paths to the root folders
#      of your local clones of the project repository and the mathbook
#      repository as described below.
#   3) The files Makefile and Makefile.paths.original
#      are managed by git revision control and any edits you make to
#      these will conflict. You should only be editing Makefile.paths.



###########
# Variables
###########

# Provide full paths for three variables,
# each without a trailing slash

# PreTeXt distribution root
# Example: PTX = ../mathbook  (or PTX = /users/oscar/GitHub/mathbook)
PTX = ../mathbook

# source clone location
# Example: BOOK = . (or DMOI = /users/oscar/GitHub/book)
BOOK = .

# Products are built in subdirectories
# of a "scratch" directory
SCRATCH = .


# These are executables to helper applications
# Provide as much of a path as is needed

# Sage executable for doctesting
SAGE = sage

# LaTeX engine, executable
# xelatex is preferable, but pdflatex is another option
ENGINE = pdflatex

# PDF viewer (eg "open -a preview" on Mac)
PDFVIEWER = open -a preview

# HTML viewer  (eg "open -a firefox", "open -a safari", on Mac)
HTMLVIEWER = open -a chrome
